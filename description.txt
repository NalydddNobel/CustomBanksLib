Custom Banks Lib is currently a WIP mod which lets you add custom 'bank's, like the Piggy Bank and Safe. Could also be used for custom chests but that'd require extra effort on your part.

Currently there are no mod calls for this lib. You will need to hard-reference it. 

To use, create a custom class and inherit from ModBank, then to activate the chest, either do:
CustomBanksLib.SetBank<MyBank>(player);
OR
player.GetModPlayer<CustomBanksPlayer>().SetBank(ModContent.GetInstance<MyBank>().Type);
